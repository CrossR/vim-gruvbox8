# Gruvbox 8 - Vim Colorscheme

This is a simplified and optimized version of
[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) that should be suitable for
inclusion in Vim. These are the main differences compared to the “official”
version:

- no plugin and filetype highlight groups to avoid messing up syntax
  highlighting;
- 3x/4x faster loading;
- reduced number of options;
- all options are documented;
- slightly different (and, IMHO, better) 256-color palette;
- no 16-color version;
- support for transparent backgrounds in terminals;
- no autoload folder, no shell scripts;
- Up to date highlight groups (e.g., ToolbarLine, ToolbarButton).
- generated by [Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate),
  i.e., easily hackable.
